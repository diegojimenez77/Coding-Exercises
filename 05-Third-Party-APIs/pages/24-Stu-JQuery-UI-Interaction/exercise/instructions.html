        # 📖 Implement a Sortable List with Drag and Drop

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a user, I want to be able to sort my list of skills using the cursor to drag and drop them.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        * It's done when the list of skills can be reorganized and sorted using drag-and-drop functionality.
        
        * It's done when a placeholder is filling empty space.
        
        ## 📝 Notes
        
        Refer to the following documentation: 
        
        [jQuery UI Demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)
        
        ## 💡 Hint
        
        * Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.
        
        ## 🏆 Bonus
        
        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
        
        * Can we implement drag-and-drop functionality without jQuery? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research how this works.
