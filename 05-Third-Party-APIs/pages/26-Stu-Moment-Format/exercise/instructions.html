        # üìñ Create Solutions to the Date Quiz

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a user, I want to be able to view the correct answers to multiple questions about dates and time.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        * It's done when every question prompt on the page is correctly answered and displayed in the correct format using Moment.js.
        
        ## üìù Notes
        
        Refer to the following documentation: 
        
        [Moment.js Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/)
        
        **Note**: `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library, but is now no longer supported by its developers. It is still functional and widely used, which is why we are introducing it through this unit.
        
        ## üí° Hints
        
        * Refer to the official [Moment.js docs on parsing](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/) to format ISO 8601 strings.
        
        * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to format the date that answers the questions and assign them to the declared variable provided.
        
        * Save often and check [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser to see your progress.
        
        ## üèÜ Bonus
        
        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
          
        * How can we measure the difference between two time stamps with `Moment.js`? Read the [Moment.js Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/) to research how this works.
