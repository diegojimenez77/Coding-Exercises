        # 📖 Add Bootstrap Components to the Page

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a developer, I want to be able to quickly put together a webpage without having to write custom CSS.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when the page has a styled navbar.

        * It's done when the page has a styled jumbotron.

        * It's done when the page has a styled and dismissible alert box.

        * It's done when the page has a styled form.

        * It's done when the page has a styled list with badges.

        * It's done when the page has a styled card with a list, header, and footer.

        ## 📝 Notes

        Refer to the following documentation: 

        [Bootstrap Documentation for Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/)

        ## Assets

        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ## 💡Hints

        * When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation links in the comments and Chrome DevTools to break down the classes and styles used!

        * Look down the left-hand side of the Bootstrap documentation to see the different types of components.

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

        * How did Bootstrap come to be, and how are CSS frameworks like it useful for developers? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this question.
