        # 📖 Create HTML Elements with jQuery

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a user, I want to be greeted with a quote by an author when I open the page.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        * It's done when the page dynamically displays a quote by an author and the author's name on load.
        
        ## 📝 Notes
        
        Refer to the following documentation: 
        
        [jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/)
        
        ## Assets
        
        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ## 💡 Hints
        
        * Don’t forget to add jQuery to `index.html` before you begin.
        
        * Only use jQuery methods! Do **NOT** use any of the following vanilla JavaScript methods: `createElement`, `textContent`, or `appendChild`.
        
        ## 🏆 Bonus
        
        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
          
        * How can we add event listeners using jQuery? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer this question.
