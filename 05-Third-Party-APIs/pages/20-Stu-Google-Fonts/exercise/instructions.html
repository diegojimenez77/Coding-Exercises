        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a user, I want to view a customized and well-designed page that uses custom colors and fonts.

        * It's done when the page's headings text uses fonts loaded from Google Fonts and not the default Bootstrap fonts. 
        
        ## üìù Notes
        
        Refer to the following documentation:

        ## üí° Hints
        
        * Remember, this is an open-ended activity! Work with your partner to find interesting fonts of your choosing. There is no right or wrong answer to this activity.
        
        * There are websites that can help you pick fonts if you are overwhelmed by the options. Visit [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!
        
        * Don't forget to use typographic CSS properties to adjust font weights and italics if you need to!
        
        ## üèÜ Bonus
        
        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 
        
        * How does Google develop their typography? You can read [Google‚Äôs design blog](https://design.google/library/google-fonts/) to learn more.
