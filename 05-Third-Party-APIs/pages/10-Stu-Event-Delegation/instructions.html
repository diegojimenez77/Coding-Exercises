        # 📖 Implement Shopping List Item Deletion

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As an online shopper, I want to have the ability to remove items from my list.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when each item's Remove button can be clicked to remove its respective shopping list item. 

        ## 📝 Notes

        Refer to the following documentation: 

        [jQuery Docs on Event Delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/)

        ## 💡 Hints

        * Use your knowledge in DOM traversal to select an element's parent.
        
        * The jQuery method for deleting an element is `.remove()`.

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

        * What are some alternatives to using jQuery? Discuss the merits with your partner. You can read this [guide to whether you need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to see some alternatives.
