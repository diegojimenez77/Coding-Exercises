        # 🏗 Add Custom Styles to the Page 

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a user, I want to visit a site that uses a custom color theme and branding.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when the page is not utilizing the generic colors provided by Bootstrap.

        ## Assets

        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ---

        ## 💡 Hints

        * There is a color theme already available to use in `style.css`, but feel free to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/).

        * Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how custom styles can be applied with CSS.

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

        * What are some other UI frameworks that we could use? To get started, try [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and a very customizable one called [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
