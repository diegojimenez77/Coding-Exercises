        # 📖 Enhance UI with jQuery UI Widgets

        Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

        * As a user, I want to easily choose a skill from a list to use in the form.

        * As a user, I want to easily select a date from a datepicker instead of writing it out manually.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when the form input for entering a skill has an autocomplete feature added to it, to pick from a list of skills.

        * It's done when the form input for entering a date has a datepicker feature added to it, to select by month and year.

        ## 📝 Notes

        Refer to the following documentation: 

        [jQuery UI Demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

        ## 💡 Hints

        * You will need to add an array of skills to use with the autocomplete widget (for example, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Bootstrap`, `React`, and `CSS`). 

        * Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the datepicker widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

        * What built-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the preceding question.
