        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a player, I want to click on a card and view the hidden number.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when I click on a card and the hidden number is revealed.

        * It's done when the number is visible if the card is clicked. 

        ## Assets

        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ![Six cards appear in a grid, with the numbers 1, 3, and 5 displayed on three of the cards while the remaining three appear blank.](./images/01-screenshot.png)

        ## üí° Hints

        How can we use the `dataset` object to access an element's data attributes? 

        ## üèÜ Bonus

        If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

        * We have learned `getAttribute()` and `setAttribute()`. What other methods can you use to access an element's attributes? 

        Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
