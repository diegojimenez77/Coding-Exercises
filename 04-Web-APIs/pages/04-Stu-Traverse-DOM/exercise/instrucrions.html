        # 🐛 Style Changes on HTML Elements Not Rendering on Page

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* Users should be able to see style changes implemented with JavaScript when the browser page loads.

* The text in the headline "Welcome to World News" is white. 

## Actual Behavior

* The article title is smaller than 50px.

* The text in the headline "Welcome to World News" is blue. 

## Assets 

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## 💡 Hints

How would you use parent-child relationships to access the elements you want to style? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Using `getElementbyId()` is just one way to return an element. What are some other document methods that allow us to quickly access elements?  

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
