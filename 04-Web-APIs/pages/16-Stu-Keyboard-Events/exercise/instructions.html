        # 📖 Implement Keyboard Events to Display Value and Code of Pressed Key

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a developer, I want to display the value and code of a pressed key.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when, if a key is pressed down, the value of the key and the key's code is displayed. `KEYDOWN Event` should also be displayed to indicate the type of event. 

        * It's done when, if the key is released, `KEYUP Event` is displayed.

        ## 📝 Notes

        Refer to the documentation: 

        [MDN Web Docs on keyup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keyup_event)

        [MDN Web Docs on keydown](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keydown_event)

        ## Assets

        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ## 💡 Hints

        What properties can we use to access the value of the pressed key and the key's code?

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

        * What other properties can you access using the `KeyboardEvent` object? 

        Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
