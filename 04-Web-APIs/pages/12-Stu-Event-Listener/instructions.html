        # 🏗️ Implement Event Handler on Mouse Click

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a developer, I want to increment or decrement a count when a user clicks on a button.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        * It's done when a user clicks on the increment button and the count is increased by `1`.
        
        * It's done when a user clicks on the decrement button and, if the count is greater than `0`, the count is decreased by `1`.
        
        ## Assets
        
        The following animation demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        * A click is just one type of DOM event. What are some others?
