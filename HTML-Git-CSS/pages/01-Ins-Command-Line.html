            <h2>Terminal commands are useful ways to navigate between folders, also called directories, quickly and easily. The commands are entered into the terminal or bash.</h2>
            <h2>Open your terminal and do the following:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> * ðŸ”‘ We use `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. In the home directory, we see a list of directories including the `Desktop` directory. 
                
                  ```bash
                  ls
                  ```</li>
                <li>* ðŸ”‘ We use `cd` to change directories. We can change into the `Desktop` directory with the following command: 
                
                  ```bash
                  cd Desktop
                  ```</li>
                <li>  * ðŸ”‘ To move back up to our previous directory, we use `cd ..`. 
                
                  ```bash
                  cd ..
                  ```</li>
                <li> * ðŸ”‘ We check our working directory with `pwd`. When we print the working directory, it shows us the path.
                
                  ```bash
                  pwd
                  ```</li>
                <li> * ðŸ”‘ To create a new folder inside the `Desktop` directory, we navigate into the `Desktop` directory using `cd`.
                
                  ```
                  cd Desktop
                  ```</li>
                <li> * ðŸ”‘ We use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `demo-folder`.
                 
                  ```bash
                  mkdir demo-folder
                  ```</li>
                <li>* ðŸ”‘ To add a file to our new directory, we first use `cd` to navigate into `demo-folder`.
                
                  ```bash
                  cd demo-folder
                  ```</li>
                  <li> * ðŸ”‘ We use `touch` to create a new file named `index.html`.
                
                  ```bash
                  touch index.html
                  ```</li>
                  <li> * ðŸ”‘ We use `ls` to check that our new file has been successfully added to the directory.
                
                  ```bash
                  ls
                  ```</li>
