        # 🏗️ Implement a fetch() Request to Display GitHub Data as HTML

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
          * As a user, I want to see a list of GitHub users and links to their profiles.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
          * It's done when I press the "Click Me" button, and a list of five GitHub users appears underneath on the page.
        
          * It's done when each user includes their login name and a URL to their GitHub profile.

        ## 💡 Hints
        
        Use the previous three exercises as references if needed to put this together.
        
        ## 🏆 Bonus
        
        If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:
        
        * What are some other third-party APIs you could make `fetch()` requests to?
        
        Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
