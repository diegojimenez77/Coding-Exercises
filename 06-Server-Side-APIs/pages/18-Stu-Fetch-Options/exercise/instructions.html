        # üìñ Implement Cache Reloading for Fetch Requests

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
        
        * As a developer, I want `fetch()` requests to reload the browser's cache.
        
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        * It's done when I make a `fetch()` request, and the `cache` option is set to `reload`.
        
        ## üìù Notes
        
        Refer to the documentation: 
        
        [MDN Web Docs on using fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
