        # üèóÔ∏è Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

        ## Assets

        The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

        ---

        ## üí° Hints

        * How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

        * Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

        ## üèÜ Bonus

        If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

        * In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI? 

        Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
