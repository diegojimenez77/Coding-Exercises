        # 📖 Implement a `fetch()` Request to Log Repository Issues

        Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

        * As a developer, I want to log issues from Twitter's Chill repository.

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        * It's done when I open Chrome DevTools, and five issues from the Chill repository are logged in the console.

        * It's done when the issue's URL and username are logged in the DevTools console.

        ## 📝 Notes

        Refer to the documentation: 

        [GitHub API documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues)

        ---

        ## 💡 Hints

        How do you add parameters to an API endpoint URL?

        ## 🏆 Bonus

        If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

        * We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an IP address. How does this work?

        Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
